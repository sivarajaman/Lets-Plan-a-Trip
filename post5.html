<p><strong>Planning a trip can feel like both the most exciting AND the most overwhelming part of travel.&nbsp;</strong>Sure, creating a Pinterest board full of gorgeous pictures is fun, but then you start trying to figure out the actual logistics and it hits you … oh god, this is SO MUCH WORK. Cue panic attacks.&nbsp;<em>Wow, I totally just described our wedding planning process, too. Anyone else?</em></p>

<p>But planning a trip doesn’t have to be the source of constant anxiety and overwhelm! Through the years, I’ve perfected my trip planning process, and I’ve got it down to a fine science.</p>

<p>Er, well, maybe not a science, but sort of like a general step-by-step outline.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Breaking down each of the steps to planning a trip helps me cut through the confusion and tackle stuff in a practical, down to earth way.&nbsp;</strong><em>Plus, it makes me feel like the most organized person on the planet, which is VERY good for my ego.</em></p>

<p>At the end of my planning process,&nbsp;I end up with a big ol’ document containing all of the information I need for my trip: everything from where I’m staying and how to get there, to what to eat. I take that document with me and refer to it constantly during my trip.&nbsp;<em>And then I come home and turn it into a blog post, for you! It’s like recycling&nbsp;in the digital age.</em></p>

<p>By the way: I’ve fully tested this entire process on Jeremy. I actually don’t plan most of our travels anymore – he does! During our&nbsp;<a href="https://practicalwanderlust.com/year-long-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year-long honeymoon</a>, I downloaded all of my travel planning knowledge into his beautiful ginger head, and he completely took the task off my shoulders, bless him. We both use the exact process outlined in this post.</p>
